                <p style="color: #c9061d; font-size: 16px"><strong>Hello @firstname,</strong></p>

                <p>Thank you for visiting <a href="http://www.cashforyourwheels.com">cashforyourwheels.com </a>, we have valued your vehicle at £@avgValue. This is subject to an inspection by one of our vehicle buyers.</p>

                <p><strong>If you have yet to book an appointment</strong>  then please call the branch on 0845-519-0898 so that it can be arranged. </p>

                <p>We always carry out an on-site inspection of a vehicle before we offer to buy it. If we consider that its value is affected by any aspect of its history or condition, including any unusual feature or customisation, which was not apparent to us when we gave the online valuation, the price that we offer for it will differ from the online valuation. We guarantee we are willing to buy every car we value. So that we don’t waste your time, if there is a change in the market value of your car resulting in a reduced valuation, then we endeavour to let you know what the new valuation is at least 24 hours before your appointment, so that you have the opportunity to cancel, if you choose to do so.</p>
                <p>We do not charge any admin fees. Your payment is made by either Cheque or Faster Payment bank transfer (same day into your bank account).</p>
                <p>Thank you for visiting our website, we look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
                <p>Kind Regards</p>
