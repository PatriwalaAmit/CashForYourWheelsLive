<p> Hello @firstname, </p>
<p> Thank you for visiting <a href="http://www.CashforyourWheels.co.uk">CashforyourWheels.co.uk</a>, we have valued your car at £@avgValue but this is still subject to insepction by our representative.</p>
<p> If you would like to proceed and book an appointment, please can you call 0845-519-9068 and quote your vehilce plate so we can find your valuatoin and arrange a visit. </p>
<p>  We always carry out an on-site inspection of a vehicle before we offer to buy it. If we consider that its value is affected by any aspect of its history or condition, including any unusual feature or customisation, which was not apparent to us when we gave the online valuation, the price that we offer for it will differ from the online valuation. We guarantee we are willing to buy every car we value. So that we don’t waste your time, if there is a change in the market value of your car resulting in a reduced valuation, then we endeavour to let you know what the new valuation is at least 24 hours before your appointment, so that you have the opportunity to cancel, if you choose to do so. </p>
<p> A transaction fee may be payable, if you decide to sell your car to us. Our standard payment terms utilise BACS payment which takes 4 working days after the day of sale to arrive at your bank account. For an additional fee of £24.75 we can provide you with the option of receiving payment via next working day payment. </p>
<p> Thank you for visiting our website, we look forward to hearing from you soon. </p>
<p>Gary </p>
